# boil-node

A template repo for simple Node.js projects.

## Goals with this template

I use Node.JS a lot for small internal tools. Typescript is a must-have when working with data, and it's hassle remembering how to set it up each time to use modern JS features. Popular GitHub Node.JS templates try to be too helpful, and slow down dev.

**This template..**

- YES - Supports modern JS features
- YES - Typescript should just work
- YES - JS is allowed too, typescript is not forced

- NO - Messing with tsc build config
- NO - Testing, just building
- NO - Aggressive linting
- NO - Git hooks, vscode settings, or other annoying defaults

## Setup

```bash
yarn
```

## Usage

To use the project, you can run the following scripts defined in the package.json file:

- **Start**:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

- **Build**:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

- **Dev**:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
